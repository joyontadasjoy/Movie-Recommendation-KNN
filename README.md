    <h1>Movie Recommendation System using KNN</h1>
    <p>This project demonstrates the use of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to build a movie recommendation system. The system recommends movies based on the similarity between the user's rating history and the ratings of other users in the dataset.</p>
    <p>The system uses the following Python libraries:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pandas</li>
      <li>Numpy</li>
      <li>Matplotlib</li>
      <li>Seaborn</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>This recommendation system is a proof-of-concept project and should not be used as a substitute for professional advice. The system makes recommendations based on the input data, and the results may not be accurate or suitable for all users. Use this system at your own risk.</p>
